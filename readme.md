Hey!  This is the marlin configuration that I use for my Ender 3.
I built it based on the SKR 1.4 example from the example configurations.
Here's the spec-list
Ender 3,
BTT SKR 1.3,
BL Touch using this bracket https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3733792
Fillament runout sensor (If you dont have one, havest the switch from your Z-Axis endstop)
and some basic config changes.  Still using the Stock Ender 3 LCD with rotary knob.
